uBO Lite (uBOL) is an MV3-based content blocker.

ڈیفالٹ رولسیٹ uBlock Origin کے ڈیفالٹ فلٹر سیٹ سے مساوی ہے:

- یو بلاک اوریجن کی بلٹ ان فلٹر لسٹ
- EasyList
- EasyPrivacy
- Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list

You can enable more rulesets by visiting the options page -- click the _Cogs_ icon in the popup panel.

uBOL is entirely declarative, meaning there is no need for a permanent uBOL process for the filtering to occur, and CSS/JS injection-based content filtering is performed reliably by the browser itself rather than by the extension. This means that uBOL itself does not consume CPU/memory resources while content blocking is ongoing -- uBOL's service worker process is required _only_ when you interact with the popup panel or the option pages.
